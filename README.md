# Micro Quadruped Robot Prototype

This project aims to construct an educational and low-cost micro quadruped robot. The implementation involves concepts such as forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, Jacobians, force calculation, and motor sizing. These concepts are crucial for achieving a robot that reproduces precise, coordinated, and adaptable movements while ensuring efficiency and stability in various situations. The robot utilizes an ESP32 microprocessor to control its actions, with three mini servos attached to each leg to mimic quadrupedal animal movements.
